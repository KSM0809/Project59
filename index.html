      <p id="1stp">'Jack of all trades, master of none'. I am completely indifferent to this sententia! I don't stop at 1 or 2, but 8 hobbies! To name some, swimming, basketball, writing poetry, baking and cookery, reading, singing, art, athletics and cycling are all on my acquaintance list. All these have helped me in innumerable ways, for example, playing sports has given me leadership qualities and diligence, while art and writing, my creativity. Baking and cooking makes me a precise and conscientious girl, while reading my favourite, genre of books, historical fiction, has matured and deepened my understanding. Singing has helped increased what was previously an extremely tiny amount of confidence. These hobbies are irreplaceable in my life, and have been the only friends I have known during this lockdown at home.</p>

minions, always backstage,<br>For far too long now, our freedom and rights have been trapped in a cage.<br>No daily palaver with kith and kin in our beloved mother tongue,<br>For far too long now, our stories and pain have gone unsung.<br>No instance where we come back from work exultant or excited,<br>For far too long now, we have remained pariahs, and our image attenuated.<br>For one precipitous act,<br>Is this the cost we pay?<br>At some point, an exception will appear in the pact,<br>And we will fight back.<br><br><br><br>My School, My pride<br>Kaavya Majumder<br><br>School is punishments

and my fears.<br>Jehangir Sabavala, Salman Rushdie and J R D Tata !<br>The stalwarts were here, do I need any more data?<br>What if I cannot live up to their standards, I despair,<br>The weight of heritage and tradition becomes difficult to bear?<br>The years that followed has put my mind at ease,<br>With teachers so compassionate, learning was a breeze!<br><br>A school is a place of worship they say,<br>Follow the rules and respect you pay.<br>Mine was a roller coaster ride……<br>Sometimes on the ebb, sometimes high tide.<br>But never a dull moment or tears to hide,<br>My heart filled with so much content and pride!<br><br>Welcome to The Cathedral and John Connon School,<br>Where YOU break the mould and make the rules!<br>Where the promising future meets the glorious past!<br>An Alma mater you love and trust, a bond that will ever last!<br><br><br><br>Plastic<br>Kaavya Majumder<br><br>Plastic is fantastic, a scientific wonder, they said<br>A century later, it is something we despise and dread!<br>It's lightweight, it's tough, transparent and waterproof<br>You don’t get quite so many qualities under one roof.<br>But we did not know how to reuse and dispose it<br>Being omnipresent, it became a nuisance and misfit.<br><br>It’s a call of action now to save our planet and wildlife,<br>Learn to live without plastic and resolve this age-old strife.<br>Until corporate profiteering stops it can’t be banished,<br>Let’s STOP buying plastic till it has totally vanished!<br>They say what cannot be cured must be endured,<br>REDUCE, REUSE and RECYCLE so our future is

          <p id="ss">Short Stories:</p>


<p>Pandemic Pandemonium<br>Kaavya Majumder<br><br>There was an emergency meeting in Mount Kailash. In attendance were three supreme gods – Benevolent Brahma (the creator), Vishnu the Visionary (the nurturer) and Shiva - the Juggernaut (the destroyer). The atmosphere was tense. The topic of discussion - Coronavirus on Earth.<br><br>“Is this your handiwork, Shiva? Were you the one who caused this pandemic pandemonium on Earth? Are you trying to destroy the planet that I meticulously created, and Vishnu nurtured with so much love and care?” Brahma demanded.<br><br>“Of course not! How will I create a new virus by myself? I would have to come to your laboratory if I had to, Brahma, you are the Creator! But be careful while you are tinkering around with new organisms in your lab, you should follow some of the guidelines the Earthlings are following right now about cleaning up. To be honest, the human race is doing a great job of destroying the earth themselves. My job is half done. I might just raise the level of the oceans couple of feet and that will be the end of humanity! Easy as pie!” Shiva said with a huge grin.<br><br>Pat came Brahma’s rebuttal, "Oh Shiva, you and your hygiene,” he snorted, “don’t worry, remember the first lesson we learnt to become a God? Cleanliness is next to godliness! Relax, all protocols are being followed in my laboratory.” <br><br>Shiva pointedly ignored Brahma, and turned to Vishnu, his voice a tad too cajoling. "Vishnu, my dear friend, would you mind doing us a little favour?" <br><br>Vishnu’s soothing voice did have a wee bit of condescension mixed, “Well it sure does feel good to know someone realizes that I exist!”<br><br>“Never mind, would you with your powers of sustenance and growth, get the poor humans back on their feet?” Shiva said. “When I find the ‘Machiavellian ignoramus’ who did this to the Earth, you watch it!” Shiva said.<br><br>Vishnu wisely replied, “Well then, my innocent Shiva, I think you would be surprised to know that the humans themselves have caused this abysmal apocalypse with their sheer greed, contempt for nature and plain stupidity! Coronavirus is just nature’s way of retaliation towards the humans, for their careless behaviour towards the order of nature,” Vishnu explained. “This period of time is the proverbial elixir for the planet, allowing nature to heal, while the relentless pursuit of growth and material comforts by humankind has taken a breather.”<br><br>“Well, that is quite true” the other two conceded. Vishnu went back to his iPhone and Shiva started playing on his portable PS4. After pondering for a while, Brahma suddenly interrupted the prolonged silence, “Listen up buddies, we have to do something to save the humans though, they are my greatest creation after all, a little too smart sometimes for their own good, but still…..”<br><br>Shiva interjected, “Wait, wait, hold on…we all know about your weakness for humans, Brahma! One thing you are forgetting is that humans are smart because you gave them cognitive abilities. They have got themselves into hot soup before and have also managed to get themselves out of it. They invented the wheel, fire, penicillin, vaccines etc, and survived two world wars and the bubonic plague without our help. Why not just leave it up to them to figure it out?”  <br><br>“You’re right, but shouldn’t we do something from our side, to help them out, like…..like….. getting rid of that guy on Earth who looks like he has jaundice? Now, what’s his name? Yes, Donald duck! No, no, my sincere apologies, Donald Trump!” Vishnu added cheekily, an arch look on his face!<br><br>“Now that is a good plan of action! Let’s get to it right away,” the other two happily agreed. Meeting adjourned.</p>
